	"title": "Predictive Maintenance for IoT Devices",
	"thumbnail": "images/iot-maintenance-thumbnail.jpg",
	"overview": "Built an end-to-end system to predict failures in industrial IoT devices, reducing unplanned downtime by 25% and maintenance costs by 18%.",
	"goals": [
		"Minimize unplanned equipment downtime",
		"Optimize maintenance schedules using predictive analytics",
		"Extend equipment lifespan through proactive interventions"
	],
	"technologies": [ "Python", "TensorFlow (Keras)", "LSTM Networks", "MQTT", "Kafka", "InfluxDB", "Grafana", "Kubernetes", "Databricks" ],
	"challenges": "Processing high-velocity, noisy streaming data from sensors and identifying subtle anomaly patterns indicative of impending failure.",
	"solutions": "Developed a scalable real-time data ingestion and processing pipeline using Kafka and Spark Streaming. Used LSTM neural networks for time-series anomaly detection. Created an intuitive Grafana dashboard for monitoring device health and alerts.",
